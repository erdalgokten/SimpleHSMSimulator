# Simple HSM Simulator
* Simple Windows Forms HSM Simulator to be used in AES key ceremony.
* AES key ceremonies are done with key exchanges.
* These key exchanges are not done in a clear key form.
* Instead, keys are shared between parties and those parties come together to construct the clear key.
* If you have an HSM machine this can be done easily.
* If you don't have it, then this simulator can be used.

# Some Terminology
* ZMK: Zone Master Key (used in the project)
